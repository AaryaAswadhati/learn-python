    #1. break the question into tokens; tokens are separated by whitespace
    #2. break tokens further if needed; e.g 1cm needs to be *split* into a number and a string
    #3. if input is parseable then a tuple should be returned as below:
    #   e.g: if question is "1cm to in"
    #        then the output on success will be (true, ["cm", "in", 1])
    #4. if input is not parseable (i.e not understandable) then a tuple
    #   as below is returned:
    #        (false, "not in my domain of expertise to answer that question")
    tokens = question.split()
    print("'{}' has {} tokens, will keep working on it".format(question, len(tokens)))


# 1. describe what this program does for the user
# 2. prompt the user type in their request
