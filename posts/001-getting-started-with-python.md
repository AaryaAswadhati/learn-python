# Getting started with Python

## Language properties
- Types are enforced (strongly typed)
- No need to declare the types of variables (dynamically typed)
- Case sensitive (foo and FOO are two different variabls)
- Whitespace is syntactically relevant (statements have to be aligned
  and use consistent whitespace spacing)
- Everything is an object (object-oriented)

## What are variables?
A variable has a value that can be many types of values such as a number

## What are built-in functions
Built in functions in python are functions that are already installed.
Some built in functions are: operators, print, float, and int

## What are strings
Strings are similar to variables only they store text.


I used all of these topic's to create a simple program and named it [convert.py](./convert.py)
