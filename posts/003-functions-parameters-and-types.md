## Functions, Parameters, and Types

## Functions
- See [Math is fun][2]
- A function takes an input and gives an output.
- when you create a function you are defining it, an example is this: def function()

## Arguments vs Parameters
- Example: we have a function that adds A and B. A and B are the parameters, now lets say the user inputed in the function, 5 and 4. 5 and 4 are the arguments. The function then returns 9.
- The difference between arguments and parameters is the argument is the value provided in a function and parameters are variables whose value is passed into the function

## Types
- A dictionary is a list of data values
- A tuple is like a list but its values cannot be changed unlike a list who's value's can be changed

## A little bit of design
- Good design has: form and function
- Form is a shape, structure, or body.
