# Getting started with Python
## Day 1
1. Variables
   - A variable has a value that can be many types of values such as a number
2. Built-in functions
   - such as print, float, and int
3. Strings
   - Strings are similar to variables only they store text


I used all of these topic's to create a simple program and named it [convert.py](./convert.py)

I also explored the syntax of Markdown.

## Day 2
1. Escaping characters
   - You use escaping (example:) when you are trying to use a single quote within a single quote string
   - Escaping looks like this: string\'s
2. Continued exploring Markdown syntax

3. Also made a simple area calculator, you can look at it here: [find-area.py](./find-area.py)

## Day 3
1. Functions
   - See [Math is fun][2]
   - A function takes an input and gives an output.
   - when you create a function you are defining it, an example is this: def function()

2. Arguments vs Parameters
   - Example: we have a function that adds A and B. A and B are the parameters, now lets say the user inputed in the function, 5 and 4. 5 and 4 are the arguments. The function then returns 9.
   - The difference between arguments and parameters is the argument is the value provided in a function and parameters are variables whose value is passed into the function
3. Types
   - A dict (short of dictionary) is a list of data values
   - A Tuple is a type of list used to store multiple values in a variable
4. A little bit of design
   - Good design has: form and function
   - Form is a shape, structure, or body.
