# Getting started with Python
## Day 1
1. Variables
   - A variable has a value that can be many types of values such as a number
2. Built-in functions
   - such as print, float, and int
3. Strings
   - Strings are similar to variables only they store text


I used all of these topic's to create a simple program and named it [convert.py](./convert.py)

I also explored the syntax of Markdown.

## Day 2
1. Escaping characters
   - When do you need to escape characters?
   - How do you escape a character?
2. Continued exploring Markdown syntax

3. Also made a simple area calculator, you can look at it here: [find-area.py](./find-area.py)
