# Getting started with Python
This week I learned about the following:
1. Variables
   -A variable has a value that can be many types of values such as a number
2. Built-in functions
   - such as print, float, and int
3. Strings
   - Strings are similar to variables only they store text


I used all of these topic's to create a simple program and named it [convert.py](./convert.py)

I also explored the syntax of Markdown. using what i learning from the link below I started the intro/cover of my book: Answer the Ques
